</div>


<p>In this pamphlet no attempt has been made to give specific
directions as to the uses of spices and condiments. It must
be borne in mind that their usage results neither from the
demands of fashion nor of a vitiated sense of taste, but from
their own germicidal and preservative qualities. From the
spiced and perfumed mummies of the Pharaohs to the spiced
apple and pickled pear of our own store-rooms, the same
reason for the use of spices exists—their antiseptic qualities.
A short account of the divers kinds and qualities of these
excellent substances may lead, it is hoped, to a more intelligent
use of them in cookery. Nothing has been said about adulteration,
for, while most of the adulterants of spices are harmless,
still, fraud lies in the fact that the buyer pays a high price for
an article part of which is worthless. As every housewife
cannot be her own chemist, her safeguard lies in buying only
of reliable spice houses.</p>

<p class="pfirst"> Maxim as ancient as the time of Democritus of Abdera
reads: “Whatever pleases the palate nourishes.” Modern
science has proven the truth of this maxim and has given
us acceptable reason why condiments are no more
necessary in palace of connoisseur than in hut of barbarian,
why they are as eagerly used by the native of Labrador as
by the swarthy son of the tropics; why they are the property of
Mohammedan, Confucian, Buddhist, Gentile and Jew, of all castes,
races and civilizations. Acting principally upon the nervous system
through the sense of smell, condiments stimulate the flow of
both the saliva and gastric juices. They materially aid digestion,
and the familiar phrase, “to make the mouth water,” states a physiological
fact. From this standpoint the fragrant aroma of steaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
coffee and the savory odor of a stew are as truly condiments as
pepper and salt; for condiments are the magic wand which transforms
most commonplace of foods into essences, subtle and delicious.
They are equally appropriate to the steaming <i>potage</i> of the French
peasant and the sacrificial altars of Palestine and Greece. Nothing
more closely tests the skill of the cook than his use of these appetizing
flavors. Like genii of the fairy tale, they are willing, versatile
and obedient as slaves; when master their pathway is strewn
with sorrowful though most aromatic wrecks of soups and <i>hors
d’œuvres</i>. They should permeate food as incense does the atmosphere,
delicate, impalpable and as indescribable as they are requisite.
The too abundant use of a certain condiment or spice, the
lack of another or the injudicious mingling of certain others will
ruin the finest pudding, sauce or soup ever compounded.</p>

<p>Condiments and spices are as ancient as civilization. The
oldest books of the scriptures, notably Exodus, Leviticus, Job and
the Canticles, make frequent reference to salt and spices, substances
which were then costly, chiefly dedicated to royalty and the
uses of temple and altar. The Greeks followed the Semitic customs
to some extent in their disposition of spices, not using them as
largely in their food as have later races. They were fond of aromatic
flavorings and it is said that the laurels of Greece, of which the
cinnamon is a species, possessed that quality to a greater extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
than those of any other country, although all laurels have aromatic
leaves.</p>

<p>Homer in the Iliad refers with naïve surprise to those people
unaccustomed to the use of salt, and in the ninth book pictures
Patroclus as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He strews a bed of glowing embers wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above the coals the smoking fragments turns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sprinkles sacred salt upon the urns.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the mediæval Romans condiments were well liked. They
made, according to one author, a pickle from the tunny fish, just as
their languorous descendants are doing to-day, and also prepared a
condiment from the intestines of the mackerel. “Liver of the
capon, steeped in milk and beccaficoes, and dressed with pepper”
was another of their highly seasoned dishes.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century Dante, in the description of the
alchemists and forgers of the tenth gulf of the Inferno, referred to
one Niccolo of Sienna, “who first the spice’s luxury discovered.”
Contemporary with him in England, William Langland, in his
“Vision of Piers the Plowman,” inquired if thou “hast in thy purse
any hot spices?”</p>

<p>Frequent reference by the writers of that day indicates that
these substances were expensive and used mainly by the luxurious.
Venice had for many years controlled the trade in spices, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
were brought overland from the Orient in immense caravans, and
not until Diaz and Vasco de Gama, in the fifteenth century, rounded
the cape of Good Hope did their costliness diminish. After that
event spices and condiments ceased to be regarded merely as luxuries
and became as necessary to the plainest of soups as to the
<i>Puree de volaille a la Bearnise</i> of the French chef.</p>

<p>All classes of people use condiments in some form, from the
wealthy epicure who flavors his terrapin with mace, salt, pepper,
and sherry to the negro who sifts okra through his fingers into his
gumbo soup or the Indian, stirring the contents of a steaming kettle
with twigs of sassafras.</p>

<p>Condiments have been defined as those substances eaten with
meat and combined with salt while spices are chiefly added to
articles containing sugar. They may be classified as follows:</p>

<p>Salt is even more valuable as a condiment than as a preservative.
It is used in every staple article of cookery and, as has been said,
“Plutarch was right when he styled salt the condiment of condiments.”
Cereals and vegetables are tasteless without the addition
of that mysterious quantity, “a pinch of salt,” bread is insipid without
a dash of it, as also are meats and puddings. Meats, when so
cooked that their own salts are not extracted, as when roasted, are
more palatable without additional salt than any other food so
prepared.</p>

<p>Though salt is unused because unattainable by certain barbaric
peoples, such as the Bedouins, it is considered to be a necessity by
all others. Aristotle relates that in Greece a salt spring was believed
to be a direct gift of the gods, salt always comprising part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the religious offerings. Salt is referred to in the scriptures more
than a score of times. In Leviticus we find the command that
“every oblation of thy meat offering shall be seasoned with salt.”
In Job occurs the question “can that which is unsavory be eaten
without salt?” The Biblical comparison to salt which has lost its
savor refers to the custom still retained in Oriental countries of
adulterating with earth the salt which
finds its way to the extremely poor, who
cannot pay the original high price. So
costly was salt in the ancient world that
the old caravan routes were first formed
for traffic in this article. The “Salarian
Way” of Rome was so named because of
its immense commerce in salt and to this
day the trade route across the Sahara is
by this means mainly supported. Recently,
the salt beds of Europe and the
salt mines and wells of the western hemisphere
have made this article so abundant
that its cheapness effectually protects it from adulteration.</p>

  <div class="caption">Clove.</div>
</div>


<p>Cloves are the unexpanded flowers of an evergreen tree found
in the East Indies and indigenous to the Molucca Islands. They
are called by the Chinese “fragrant nails” owing to the peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
shape of the dried clove buds, and the English word is derived from
the Latin <i>clavus</i>, and French <i>clou</i>, also meaning nail. It is doubtful
if cloves were known to the Greeks or Romans, the Venetians
having first obtained them from the Arabians, while the clove trade
was later monopolized by the Portuguese. Then it was owned by
the Dutch who expelled the Portuguese from the Spice Islands in
1605. The Dutch made great effort to control the entire spice trade
of these islands, which was a source of abundant wealth, and were
even known to furnish the market with the adulterated article, the
oil of clove being extracted by pressure and the buds being given a
fresh appearance by a glaze of olive oil. They also preserve the
mother clove, or fully developed fruit. This resembles the olive in
appearance and, being less pungent in flavor than the bud, makes a
dainty sweetmeat. The clove tree is not hardy and grows best when
planted in loamy soil, sheltered from the winds by the hills. It has
been introduced into the West Indies and Guiana. Cloves from the
Moluccas and Ceylon are more valuable, being richer in oil, darker
in color and far more aromatic.</p>

<p>Cinnamon is the inner bark of a tree allied to the laurels. It is
indigenous to Ceylon and the Penang Islands although believed by
some authorities to have originally come from China, where it has
flourished since the remotest times. As it is mentioned in the Old
Testament it is conjectured that the Hebrews obtained it from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Arabians who in turn procured it from India. Later it was mentioned
by Herodotus. It is known that Hippocrates used cinnamon
medicinally and the modern medical world has but recently made
the discovery that oil of cinnamon is a valuable antiseptic and
germicide. Not until 1506 was cinnamon discovered wild in Ceylon
and not until 1770 was it improved by cultivation. The tree grows
to a height of twenty and occasionally thirty feet, although, as the
bark from the young shoots is of finer flavor, that only is used.
Cinnamon shrubs are cultivated in fields, the finest being located in
the region of Colombo, Ceylon. The shoots, which grow in clusters
of from four to ten, are cut to the roots twice a year, after the rains.
The epidermis is peeled off, the bark is put up in bundles about
forty inches long and thus dried and marketed. Three grades are
exported, the finest, thin, of a brownish yellow color, fragrant and
sweet of odor and correspondingly high of price. It is also adulterated
with cassia bark, a cheaper production.</p>

<p>Cassia is the inner bark of a species of cinnamon called Chinese
cinnamon or <i>cassia lignea</i>. The greater part of it is exported from
China. The bark is put up in bundles about half the length of
cinnamon bark and is more pungent and less sweet of flavor. Cassia
buds are the unripened fruits of the tree which produces Chinese
cassia. In shape and size they resemble cloves, in aroma, cinnamon,
and are usually preserved whole for sweetmeats or spices. Cassia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
is mentioned by Moses as an ingredient of the holy oil, in Psalms as
a perfume and in Ezekiel as a spice.</p>

<p>Allspice, sometimes called Jamaica pepper and properly,
<i>pimento</i>, is native to the Island of Jamaica and has not been successfully
cultivated outside of the West Indies. The pimento tree
is an evergreen of the myrtlebloom family, all of which are exotic
trees, and reaches a height of thirty feet. The allspice of commerce
consists of the berries of this tree, exported whole after being dried,
and so called because their aroma resembles that of cloves, cinnamon,
juniper and nutmeg. The berries are gathered when green,
being left on the twigs until dried by the sun, by which means all
the essential oil is retained.</p>

  <div class="caption">Nutmeg.</div>
</div>

<p>Nutmeg is the kernel of the fruit of an exotic evergreen tree
native to the Banda and other of the East Indian islands. In appearance
it resembles the orange, yielding fruit
when eight or nine years of age and bearing
for fifty or sixty years. It requires a light soil,
moisture and shade, and cannot be propagated
in regions in which these conditions are not
present. The tree bears fruit during most of
the year, in the Molucca and other islands three
crops a year being gathered. The fruit, which
requires nine months in which to mature, is
carefully dried before the pericarp is removed and the
kernel taken out. There are three varieties, the male or barren,
the royal and the queen, the last, a small, round nutmeg, considered
most valuable. The inferior nutmegs are used for the
extraction of nutmeg butter or oil, known as “oil of mace.” About
six per cent of volatile oil is contained. It is stated that more nutmegs
are exported to the United States than to all Europe. The
Dutch formerly preserved the entire fruit, kernel and pericarp, in a
syrup of sweet vinegar for a sweetmeat. This nation when in control
of the spice trade of certain of the East Indian islands made
strenuous efforts to confine the nutmeg tree to the Bandas. But
the “nutmeg bird,” a species of blue pigeon, frustrated their designs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
by scattering the nuts all over the islands after feeding upon their
pulpy covering. So determined at one time were the Dutch to keep
the price of nutmegs high that, if an unusually large harvest occurred,
part of it was burned by them.</p>

<p>Mace is the reticulated aril covering the kernel. When fresh, it
is of a crimson color, reaching the golden tint only when dried and
after some months. In its properties it is similar to the nutmeg.
The leaves of the nutmeg tree as well as the fruit are highly aromatic.</p>

<p>The cardamon is a member of the ginger family and is native to
Malabar, Madagascar and Ceylon. That from the latter country
is of quite large size. It consists of a rhizome or root stock from which
rise tall, flag-like leaves. The flower stem springs directly from the
root and is much shorter, bearing racemiform clusters of small
white flowers. The fruit consists of greenish pods half an inch in
length, each pod being three capsuled and containing numerous
seeds. These seeds are pungent in flavor and constitute the valuable
part of the plant. The pods are dried slowly as rapid drying
causes them to split, thereby losing the seeds. Cardamon seeds
were used by the ancient Greeks both as a spice and as medicine.</p>

<p>Pepper, with cinnamon, salt and incense, was one of the staple
commodities which anciently passed over the caravan routes between
Venice and India. At that time its price was extremely
high and, according to E. M. Holmes, rents were frequently paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in this article as late as the middle ages. After the sack of
Rome by the barbarians one of the articles of tribute demanded
by Alaric was a thousand pounds of pepper. As
late as the eighteenth century the pepper trade was
confined to the Portuguese. In recent years it has
become one of the cheapest of our spices.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp30" id="image012" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img  src="images/image012.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Round Pepper.</div>
</div>

<p>The pepper plant is a vine, of the order <i>piperaceæ</i>,
which grows wild in China, is also indigenous
to Malabar and other islands of the East
Indies, and has been introduced into the West
Indies. The plants require a rich moist soil,
bearing after the fourth year and continuing
fruitful for from eight to fourteen years. The most famous of
the pepper islands are the Penang, which furnish more than
half the amount produced by the entire East Indies. Only
the berries of the pepper plant are valuable and these, being
gathered before fully developed, have a wrinkled appearance when
dried. The berries used for white pepper are decorticated either in
the islands or in London and reach the United States ready for
grinding. The finest grade passes through more than twenty different

<p>Black pepper differs from the white in the leaving on of the
hull, which is black and contains the acrid principles of the flavor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Hence, white pepper is less pungent and fully as fine in flavor as
the black. Shot pepper consists of the finest berries, those richest
in oil. It is selected by throwing a quantity of the berries in water.
Those which sink are collected, labeled, and sold as shot pepper.</p>

<p>Long pepper, referred to by the Greeks as <i>piperi macron</i>, is the
unripe fruit of a species of pepper, an inch or more in length and
and shaped like a spike. The flavor is similar to that of ordinary
black pepper. African pepper is another variety. Those best
known to the western markets are Penang, Tellicherry and Malabar.</p>

<p>Cumin or cummin is a small herbaceous plant, native to Egypt
and very early cultivated in the Mediterranean countries. It is now
grown in India, Sicily and Malta, the seeds only being valuable.
These contain a large proportion of essential oil which gives them
an aromatic but acrid flavor. They are not now used in cookery
though receipts are still extant which prove them to have once
been considered a valuable culinary spice. The Latin poets relate
that the ancients used cumin seeds medicinally, their effect being
to produce languor. They are referred to in Isaiah as being
“beaten out with a rod” and also in the Mosaic law regarding tithes.</p>

<p>Coriander is a small umbelliferous plant native to the eastern
of the Mediterranean countries but now cultivated quite generally
in both Europe and America. The fruits, erroneously called the
seeds, are nearly always mentioned in the earlier recipes for meats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
and puddings and to this day many a country housewife considers
them indispensable to the flavoring of
dried apple pies. The plant grows wild
in all parts of Palestine, especially in the
Jordan valley.</p>

<p>Fenugreek is an herbaceous plant allied
to the clover. It is native to the
Asiatic countries and is still cultivated in
France and Germany. The seeds were
formerly used as a spice, but now only as
an ingredient of curry powder, owing to
their strong, bitter and unpleasant flavor.</p>

<p>Grains of Paradise are the dried seeds of a reed-like plant allied
to the ginger family and indigenous to western Africa. The fruit
which contains the seeds is four or five inches in length and of a
bright red color. The seed are now never used, excepting occasionally
by brewers. Formerly they were esteemed as a spice for cookery
and were one of the ingredients of the famous Norwich herring pies
of old England. In flavor they are extremely hot and pungent.</p>

<p>Anise is a little annual of the order umbelliferæ and scarcely
more than a foot in height. It is indigenous to Europe, although
cultivated in many of the northern Mediterranean countries. The
seeds are powerful aromatics, used both medicinally and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
preparation of a <i>liqueur</i> called “anisette,” which is to the Italians
what kümmel is to the Germans. The star
anise is a tree allied to the magnolias,
the seeds of which are stronger and less
pleasant of flavor than those of the common
anise. They are called star aniseed
from the star-like shape of the fruit.
The anise mentioned in the New Testament
as part of the tithes is a different
plant, believed to be dill.</p>

<p>Dill is a small herb, native to Spain,
which produces umbelliferous stalks of
yellow flowers. It is still cultivated in
portions of temperate Europe. An aromatic
oil is extracted from the tiny seeds
which are also used, whole, for flavoring
pickles.</p>

<p>Caraway is also an umbelliferous
plant growing wild in the meadows and
pastures of both Europe and Asia. It is
cultivated for its mildly aromatic seeds,
although in the northern countries of
Europe the root, which resembles the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
parsnip, is also eaten. No aromatic of temperate climates is more
common than the dainty, white-blooming plant growing in the
kitchen gardens of both hemispheres. Its seeds are used for the
spicing of cheese, cakes and candies, and in Germany in the rye
bread called “kümmel-brod,” which is universally eaten. The
seeds are also used in the making of an aromatic cordial called
“kümmel.”</p>

<p>Basil is not now used as extensively in cooking
as formerly. Its native haunts are India and Persia,
although since it yields gracefully to culture, it is
to be found in many old-fashioned kitchen gardens.
Its aromatic properties are similar to those of other
garden herbs.</p>

<p>Chervil is an umbelliferous annual possessing
aromatic leaves and somewhat resembling
parsley in flavor. It is used in Europe as a pot-herb
for soups and stews, but is chiefly known in
America as one of the obsolete delicacies which
deserve to be still popular. The root, which is
fleshy and fusiform in shape, is cooked and eaten
by the people of southern Europe.</p>

<p>Celery is a veritable plebeian, originally growing
wild in the ditches and fens of Europe, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
coarse, offensive and poisonous vegetable. Few plants are so susceptible
to the influences of cultivation and it is difficult to recognize its
unaristocratic prototype in the tender, white and aromatic stalks of
the garden product. It belongs to the parsley family and every portion
is useful to the cook, from the daintily curled tops which may be
used for both flavor and garnish, the stalks which may be eaten
plain, dressed raw in salad or cooked, to the seeds, the flavor of
which makes even the poorest of soups relishable. The seeds are
now commonly ground for the making of “celery salt” or “celery
pepper,” as the same product is variously called. A variety of
celery, called <i>celeriac</i>, is cultivated in certain European countries,
notably Germany, the root only, which is large and fleshy, being
eaten. The famous “wild celery” of Chesapeake Bay is simply “eelgrass,”
an aquatic plant which bears no relationship whatever to the
umbelliferæ, of which order celery is a species.</p>

<p>Fennel is an umbelliferous plant, native to portions of temperate
Europe and Asia, especially Portugal. The fruits possess an
aromatic flavor while the tender shoots are used for salad. The
plant and its culinary value was well known to the Romans, and it is
to-day cultivated in both Europe and America. The fruits of the
European fennel are used in the making of an aromatic drink,
while in America the plant is chiefly cultivated for its leaves. It
has been said that fennel is to fish what mint is to lamb, and in cer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>tain
of the southern states mackerel is considered of too strong a
flavor to be eaten unless cooked with fennel. The fennel thus used
grows wild, the green leaves being tied in bunches and boiled with
the fish.</p>

</div>

<p>Bay leaves are the
leaves of a shrub belonging
to the laurel
tribe, which grows wild
in the Mediterranean
countries. Among the
Greeks the bay leaf was
consecrated to the uses
of poetry, heroism and
religion. Not until later
times was it used as a flavoring for foods and for the decoration
of various dishes. It grows wild in certain of the southern
states but the leaves are usually exported from Europe, dried. The
leaves are used in soups, stews and pickles and, although the average
housewife finds it next to impossible to procure them, scarcely a
recipe for these articles of food but includes bay leaves among its
flavorings.</p>

<p>Summer savory is a hardy little annual which has long grown
wild in southern Europe and is now largely cultivated for culinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
use. Both the summer and winter savories are fragrant and are
valuable in the seasoning of sausages and gravies.</p>

<p>Parsley is a native of the island of Sardinia and, having been
improved in both fragrance and appearance by culture, is more valuable
than any other herb for the garnishing of dishes. Its curled,
crisp, green leaves give the poorest salad or meat a tempting appearance,
well sustained by the fineness of flavor it imparts.
Its flavor somewhat resembles that of celery. The little herb
may be seen in nearly every garden during the summer months
and often in a pot, or kitchen window-box during the winter, from
which it may be plucked fresh daily. The experienced cook would
part with any other half dozen condiments more willingly than
with parsley. The plant belongs to the <i>umbelliferæ</i>, which order includes
the carrot, parsnip and celery. It is said to have come
originally from Egypt and mythology represents Hercules as adorning
his head with its curled leaves.</p>

<p>Thyme, a little under shrub native to the Mediterranean countries,
is allied botanically to sage, summer savory and sweet basil.
It possesses very small leaves and whorls of tiny, lilac-colored
flowers, from which thymol or oil of thyme, a valuable germicide, is
distilled. In flavor it is fragrant and aromatic and it may be
readily cultivated in gardens. The wild thyme of our banks “where
ox-lips and the nodding violet grows,” is a different variety of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
same order. Its name is derived from the Greek word <i>thumos</i>,
meaning incense or perfume.</p>

<p>Sage is a small plant of the order <i>labiatæ</i>, and is native to
southern Europe. It has been so greatly changed by cultivation
that little semblance of the original plant now remains in the sage
of our gardens excepting the flavor. It was known to the ancients
and to-day its fragrant, grayish green leaves constitute one of our
commonest flavorings.</p>

<p>It was an Englishman who once said that “mint made lamb out
of an old sheep”! Perhaps he loved it also because of the legend
that it once existed in the form of a beautiful maiden, transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
by Persephone into the modest aromatic of our gardens. The mint
designated is that member of the labiate family known as spear
mint, native to Europe but grown in all portions of the United
States and largely marketed. It is a small, green herb, the leaves
being highly aromatic and, when bruised, yielding a valuable essential
oil. It is equally liked in the mint sauce so indispensable to
mutton and the mint-julep—</p>

leaves.</p>

<p>Tarragon is a small, aromatic herb, native to
Liberia. It is cultivated in Europe and is the
<i>estragon</i> of the French, who use the young
plants largely for salads. It is hardy, and is
grown extensively in America, being used for
flavoring vinegar, mustard and pickles. Tarragon
vinegar, from the excellence of its flavor,
should have a place in every household.</p>

<p>The onion is believed to have originated in
Egypt although it was known in very early times
in India. In the former country it was worshiped as a deity.
“Cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
and the garlick” formed the daily food of the Israelites in
Egypt. Italy and Spain are now noted for the immense
size of the onions grown there, as also are the Bermuda
Islands. Those of the latter place possess a far milder flavor, a
condition due to soil and climate. The flavor of onion, when strong,
is unpleasant to some people to a nauseating degree and it is hard
to see in it any resemblance to its dainty cousins, the lily and the
hyacinth. But when skillfully used it is a valuable and wholesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
culinary condiment and is more largely employed by the average
cook than the uninitiated ever suspect. Says one author: “The
onion is the sheet anchor of the skillful cook. It is impossible to
prepare the delicate Bordelaise sauce without resorting to the use
of onions and a shade of garlic, ... and it is the judicious use
of these two seasonings that stamps the expert cook.”</p>

<p>The leek is a member of the onion family, similar in flavor,
although milder, and the leaves of which are flat instead of tubular.
It has been stated that in England the leek was once considered to
be the typical plant, both onion and garlic being but species. The
diet of the soldiers of ancient Greece was at one time leeks and
cheese, a custom which Bulwer has satirized in a Neo-Greek outburst
of rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Garlic possesses an onion-like bulb around which smaller bulbs
cluster, the whole covered by a membranous outer layer. Each
bulb is described as a “clove” of garlic and in flavor is far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
demonstrative than onion. Shallot, on the contrary, is the daintiest
of the onion tribe, growing from a cluster of roots
and never forming a compact bulb.</p>

<p>Saffron, a plant of the crocus family, was largely
used in mediæval Europe as a condiment, although to-day
its value as a coloring substance is considered of
most account. The coloring matter is obtained from
the stigmas of the flower, which are of a deep orange
hue. The plant grows wild in Asia Minor, is possibly
native to Arabia, and has long been extensively cultivated
throughout the Mediterranean countries. That exported from
Spain is considered the finest. At one time in Germany the
adulteration of saffron was held criminal and punishable by death.
History records the burning, in 1444, of a man with his adulterated
saffron and, a dozen years later, the burning of two men and a woman
for a similar offense. The salutary effect of this penalty was not
permanent, however, as it is to-day extensively adulterated with a
cheaper article known as safflower. In the Orient, a few nations still
add saffron to their rice both for flavor and color while in Europe it
is now most largely used for coloring macaroni, vermicelli and other
pastes. Saffron is mentioned in the Old Testament in connection
with spikenard, cinnamon and other spices, and appears to have been
used by the early Greeks medicinally, and as both dye and perfume.</p>

<p>Capers are the unopened flowers of a
low, trailing shrub which grows wild in
Africa and southern Europe. It is native
to Italy and is said to have grown wild
upon the walls of ancient Rome. It is
cultivated in France, only the small, grayish
green, flower buds being of commercial
value. They possess an aromatic and
slightly pungent flavor and, when preserved
as is usual in either salt or vinegar,
are used for flavoring gravies, being well-nigh
indispensable in the serving of roast
mutton. Four or five grades of capers
are exported, the finest grade consisting
of the tiniest and most perfect buds which gradually diminish in
value as they increase in size.</p>

<p>Turmeric, while classed with condiments owing to its pungent
and aromatic properties, is most extensively used as a coloring
agent. It is obtained from the root of the <i>curcuma longa</i>, a plant
allied to the ginger family and native to India and Annam. It is
used as a condiment only by the Orientals who flavor their rice with
it, its greatest value to the cooking world being due to the fact that
it is one of the chief ingredients of curry powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Curry powder is a manufactured condiment, one of the most
aromatic and highly seasoned used. It originated in the East
Indies, through the skill of whom it is not known. The story goes
that the famed and delicious cookery of the Orient came about in
this fashion. The early English, French and Dutch, when setting
out for the East Indies, each determined to seize and appropriate
the islands, spices and all; for fear of being compelled to eat poor
and unappetizing food took with them their most accomplished
cooks. From the friendly concourse of these chefs arose certain
of the celebrated eastern dishes, and from its ingredients it is easy
to believe that curry was one of them; for in it are united, with the
herbs of the temperate zones, the spices and fruits of the tropics.
The ingredients used vary in character and in proportion according
to the different houses or localities manufacturing it. One recipe
calls for the following: turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg,
ginger, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, cardamon seeds, coriander
seeds, cumin seeds, caraway seeds and fenugreek. In India the following
ingredients are sometimes used, besides those above named:
anise, almonds, asafœtida, butter (ghee), cocoanut and cocoa oil,
cream and curds, various nuts, garlic, lime juice, mangoes, saffron,
salt, and tamarinds. In India alone there exist nearly forty
different methods of preparing curry, to which list might be added
the recipes of the numerous spice houses of Europe and America.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
The ingredients of curry are always finely ground and well mixed.
When lime-juice and butter or oil are added to the curry, a paste is
prepared. This is preserved by being packed in earthen jars. The
curries and curry pastes of Ceylon and Java (these being often combined
with garlic) are quite as celebrated as those of India, while
the English and American preparations rank enviably high.</p>

</div>

<p>The mustard of commerce consists of the pulverized seed of the
mustard plant, which grows wild in England and which may be
cultivated in nearly every part of the globe, even in India. The use
of mustard as a condiment dates from the Elizabethan age, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
it was used medicinally by the most celebrated physicians of
antiquity. It was first compounded in its present form for table
use by an old lady of Durham, from which circumstance it came to
be widely celebrated as “Durham mustard.” One of the merchants,
to whom this industrious old lady sold her mustard, is credited with
saying that he owed his wealth, not to the
mustard which people ate but to that which
they left on their plates. Two varieties of
mustard are cultivated, one producing white
seeds, the other, seeds which are tiny and black.
Both varieties of seeds are used, whole, in the
spicing of pickles. It is requisite that mustard
possess good keeping qualities, that it be of a
bright yellow color, and have an aromatic as
well as pungent flavor.</p>

<p>Horse-radish is a plant allied to the nasturtium
and, like the seeds and stems of the
latter, possesses a sharply pungent flavor. It
is native to England and western Europe
although cultivated in nearly all portions of
the temperate zone. The root, which is large
and fleshy, is grated, mixed with salt and
vinegar, and used as a condiment. It may be prepared in season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and bottled, either with vinegar or dessicated, keeping for use
during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>Ginger is a flag-like plant, probably native to the East and
West Indies, the rhizomatous root of which is the only portion
commercially valuable. According to some authorities ginger was
known to the earliest of the Greeks and Romans and has been
a common spice among the nations of Europe, including England,
since the eleventh century. Under the Plantagenets and Tudors
ginger was used as a flavoring for meats, unlike the modern
custom of using it only in curries, cakes and beverages. To-day
ginger is exported from both the Indies, that from Jamaica
being particularly fine, from Africa, from China, from India
and from Borneo. The African ginger is of excellent flavor
but of dark color. It is chiefly sold to bakers. That from Borneo
is good for household use, having a sweet and aromatic flavor and containing
very little fibre. From Calcutta the “race” or “hand” ginger
is exported, so called because of the palmate shape of the root.
It is exported before being decorticated and is not a high grade
ginger. The root is often preserved in sugar, being taken when
young and succulent. It may be preserved whole or cut into
cubes or slices. Both preserved and dried it is largely exported
from China and Japan.</p>

<p>Chili is the Spanish name for the pod of the cayenne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the Guinea pepper, and other species of capsicum. Capsicum
is a member of the night shade family, in no
way related to the true pepper. It is native to tropical
America, although now found in nearly all of the
warmer countries. Cayenne is the pod of the capsicum
pulverized to extreme fineness. It should be of a dull,
red color and, if very red, is quite likely to be adulterated,
often with red lead or vermilion. Cayenne pepper
is, perhaps, the most acrid and pungent aromatic
used and is also valuable medicinally. There are many varieties of
capsicum, the most noted being the <i>capsicum annuum</i>, cultivated in
the East Indies, in Mexico and southern parts of the United States,
and from which cayenne pepper is made; and the <i>capsicum frutescens</i>,
the Guinea or bird pepper, a much smaller pod and which,
dried whole, is most often used in cookery. Chilis are used in enormous
quantities by natives of hot countries, a paradoxical custom it
appears to be, and the hottest, most “peppery” dishes known have
originated where the sunbeam is nearest vertical. Those best
known to Americans are the <i>chili con carne</i> and the chicken <i>tomale</i>
of Mexico. In the southern states cayenne is customarily added to
all meats, soups and stews. Capsicum is an agreeable and valuable
stimulant, having the medicinal effect of alcohol without disastrous
results from its use.</p>

<p>Mixed seasonings are now to be found in nearly all markets and
in point of convenience deserve to be popular. They consist of the
aromatic herbs and spices, mixed and prepared by experts and intended
for the seasoning of poultry and meats of all kinds.</p>

<p>Penang or mixed spices, are also a modern preparation and are
useful in cooking, pickling and preserving. They consist of aromatic
and pungent spices mixed in varying proportions.</p>

<p>Among condiments prepared from animal foods, those of the
anchovy, lobster, shrimp, and Yarmouth bloater are the most common.
The anchovy is a tiny, silvery fish, caught in the Mediterranean
sea in vast quantities. The most famous come from Gorgona, a
small island near Leghorn, where they are caught in nets as they
come in from the deeper waters for the purpose of depositing spawn.
Anchovies were used as a condiment by the most luxurious of the
Romans, one preparation, called “garum,” consisting of the partly
decomposed intestines of this fish mixed with spices. They are now
exported for use as a condiment to all parts of the world, being preserved
whole as well as in the form of pastes and essences. The
pastes are prepared by pressing the fish through a sieve, simple
flavorings and some oil being added. The essences consist of the
fish steeped in a highly spiced brine or pickle, then strained and
bottled. Essences of lobster, shrimp, and various fish are similarly
prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Various appetizing mixtures intended to give relish to meats,
fish and soups, and composed of vegetables, fruits and divers spices,
are known as sauces. “Roots, herbs, vine fruits and salad-flowers,
they dish up various ways and find them a very delicious sauce to
their meats, both roasted and boiled, fresh and salt.” No other
sauce made compares with genuine East Indian chutney. It is a
thick sauce, made from the mango apple, chilies, spices, lemon juice,
raisins, figs, salt and sugar. Those most celebrated are the Bengal
Club, Terhoot, Sweet Lucknow and a number of club chutneys.
Trinidad chutney is particularly fine. Ceylon chutney is often
slightly flavored with garlic. Another kind is “mango chutney, a
characteristic Singalese condiment, among the ingredients of which
are fresh, grated cocoanut and chilies carefully brayed together in a
mortar. This chutney is of a rich roseate hue; and after eating it
with his prawn curry the epicure feels like the Grand Turk.”</p>

<p>Carachi is a sauce little known in America, although, as it is
much liked abroad, I give a recipe for its making, which sufficiently
defines its character: one head of garlic, one dessert spoonful of
cayenne pepper, three table spoonsful each, of soy, mushroom
ketchup, walnut pickle, and mango pickle, five anchovies and a pint
of vinegar.</p>

<p>Cassareep consists of the inspissated juice of the root of the
bitter cassava, flavored with various spices. From the cassava, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
manioc, is prepared tapioca and also cassava flour of which bread
is made. The root is poisonous because of the prussic acid contained,
this, however, being dissipated by heat. After the juice is
extracted, it is boiled down to the color and consistency of molasses,
after which spices are added. It is the basis of Worcestershire and
many other sauces and is valuable in the flavoring of soups and
ragouts. It is largely exported from British Guiana and is used
throughout the tropics.</p>

<p>Worcestershire sauce is one of the commonest of table condiments.
It is prepared from cassareep and varying proportions of
spices, garlic, peppers, and lime-juice, according to the tastes of the
various houses manufacturing it.</p>

<p>Both lime-juice and Devonshire sauces are similar in preparation
and flavor to Worcestershire, the former being quite acid, owing
to the greater proportion of lime-juice used.</p>

<p>Ketchup is a sauce made variously from tomatoes, mushrooms,
walnuts, oysters, etc. It should be semi-fluid, about the consistency
of a good purée and, although spices may be added, the original
flavor of the basic ingredients must always be preserved. Color is
one desideratum. In tomato ketchup the sauce is always made of
the ripe tomato fruit, although, as the color is sometimes produced
artificially, the only safeguard lies in purchasing of reliable manufacturers.
The tomato ketchup is a typical American sauce, corre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>sponding
in our dietary with the mushroom ketchup of the English.</p>

<p>Soy or <i>shoyu</i> is in general use throughout the East, particularly
in China and Japan, that from the latter country being acknowledged
the finest made. One authority states that our word ketchup is derived
from the Chinese name for soy, <i>kitjap</i>. The basis of soy,
the soy bean, has been cultivated in Japan since the earliest
dynasties, and is to-day one of their important crops. The different
varieties of the soy bean produce three kinds of soy known as the
black, the green and the white. The process of making soy consists
in first boiling the beans and mixing them with parched barley and
wheat, coarsely ground. This <i>barm</i> is fermented and when the
whole mixture is covered with fungi it is mixed with brine of a certain
strength, which has already been boiled and allowed to cool.
This mixture is then kept for fermentation about twenty-five
months. It is stirred with a wooden paddle twice a day during
winter, three times a day in summer and, when sufficiently fermented,
is put through a soy press. It is then heated to 130 degrees
Fahrenheit and, after becoming cold again, is put up in bottles and
casks. It may be preserved for any length of time. In appearance
it resembles Worcestershire sauce and from a nutritive point of
view is superior to any other sauce in our markets.</p>

<p>Soy is manufactured in every part of Japan, no fewer than
10,682 firms being engaged in making it in 1891. It is eaten by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
entire Japanese population with every meal and, besides being a
sauce, is sufficient as a salt. Used upon fish, beef-steaks and meats,
generally, it gives a relish that is impossible to the choicest of cookery
otherwise. In Japan it is used by all classes excepting the
extremely destitute, who cannot afford to buy it.</p>

<p>Tabasco is a popular sauce, the chief ingredient of which is the
pulp of the red pepper. This, a species of chili, came originally
from Central America and through cultivation, largely carried on in
the South, its strength and flavor have been greatly improved. The
sauce is extremely hot with chilis and, as it keeps well in any climate,
it is liked by connoisseurs.</p>

<p>There are on the market numerous preparations known as salad
dressings. They are useful in cases of inexperience or emergency,
but are by no means equal to the freshly made mayonnaise of the
home kitchen. There is real art in preparing a good mayonnaise
and a Spanish proverb reads: “Four persons are necessary to the
making of a salad dressing: a spendthrift for oil, a miser for vinegar,
a counsellor for salt and a madman to stir it all up.”</p>

<p>Pickles are those articles of food, fruit or vegetables, which are
preserved by immersion in vinegar, with or without the addition of
salt or spices. Cucumber and green tomato pickles are the commonest
varieties. When vegetables are mixed, as with chow-chow,
piccalilli and “mixed pickles,” cucumbers, small onions, green beans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
cabbage, pepper-pods, cauliflower and various spices are used.
Fruits, such as apple, melon, peach, crab-apple and pear are also
pickled.</p>

<p>Pickled sanphire, although at one time popularly used as a condiment,
is now little known outside of England. It is a variety of
sea-weed and grows upon dangerous and rocky cliffs. Shakespeare
refers to “the sanphire gatherer’s dangerous trade,” and another poet
has apostrophized the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Green girdles and crowns of the sea gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cool blossoms of water and foam,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>quite omitting to mention the fact that the “girdles and crowns”
make, when chopped and packed in vinegar, a most delicious pickle.
Unlike most condiments, this is, as are all seaweeds, nutritious.
The people of the Sandwich Islands, as well as the English, consider
sanphire, both the true and false varieties, a choice condiment. It
is specially liked when served with mutton.</p>

<p>One of the choicest of condiments is the olive. It is the fruit of
an evergreen tree, native to Syria and lower Asia but now cultivated
extensively in southern Europe and California. Unlike most
pickles it may be classed as a food, owing to the oil contained. The
fruit is picked by hand and carefully sorted about six weeks before
it would ripen. It is first placed in strong lye for about twenty-four
hours, then removed to fresh water where it may remain several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
days. After several washings in fresh water the olives are removed
and packed in brine. They are ready for use in from one to three
months. The residents of the olive districts
both in Greece, Spain, and in California often
prefer the olive preserved after it has ripened,
the oil having then matured and the flavor
being finer. Among the export trade there is
much prejudice against it owing to its dull,
black color. Olives should be of good color,
crisp and firm, but never tough. The Spanish
and Italian olives are widely popular but are
really no finer than the best California products.</p>

  <div class="caption">Candle-nut.</div>
</div>

<p>The candle-nut, used as a relish and somewhat
resembling a green walnut, is the fruit of
a tropical tree. It is chopped fine, packed in
jars, or bottled, with salt added. As a relish
it is highly prized, specially by the natives of the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>Flavors are used almost entirely in the making of sweetmeats,
candies and pastry. Vanilla is perhaps the most choice, being
invariably used in the preparation of chocolate and cocoa for the
market. The vanilla vine is an orchid, native to Central America,
and cultivated in South America, the West Indies, Mexico, and
upon the islands of the Indian and southern Pacific oceans. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
vanilla of commerce is made from the delicate, volatile oil extracted
from the seed-pods. These are several inches in length
and great care is exerted in curing that the flavor be not destroyed.
The curing process occupies about six months. The vanilla plant
bears fruit when about three years old, remaining productive for
thirty or forty years. The best vanilla is exported from Mexico,
while that from Brazil is of an inferior quality.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp60" id="image038" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img  src="images/image038.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Vanilla Vine and Bean.</div>
</div>

<p>The Tonka bean, called also
Tongua and Tonquin bean, is frequently
sold as a substitute for or
adulterant of vanilla. It belongs to
the <i>leguminosæ</i>, producing thick,
short pods from which an oil, resembling
vanilla, is extracted. The
tree is common in British Guiana and
the tropics and grows to an immense
size. It is much cheaper commercially
than vanilla.</p>

<p>The extract of bitter almond consists
of a tincture made from the
kernel of the nut. The tree of the
bitter almond originated, it is believed,
in Prussia, although now growing wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
in southern Europe. The flavor obtained from the kernel is due to the
prussic acid developed in the process of making the tincture. A similar
flavor exists in the kernel and leaves of the peach, a tree allied
botanically to the almond. Flavoring extracts are also made from
the orange, lemon, strawberry, and other fruits. They are also produced
chemically, as many alleged fruit-flavors found upon the
market prove, from the coal-tar products.</p>

<p>The pistachio or pistache nut is particularly liked by confectioners
because of its delicate flavor, resembling that of the almond.
It is the kernel of a pine-tree, is small and of a light green color.
It is native to Europe and the far East.</p>

<p>Cordials or <i>liqueurs</i> are used both for flavoring pastries and
ices and, in the way of beverages, as aids to the digestion. In
the latter case they are taken in very small quantities just at the
close of a meal.</p>

<p>Curaçoa is one of the most celebrated of cordials. It was
originally made in the island of Curaçoa, whence its name, and is
prepared from limes, orange peel and spices. It is still an important
source of revenue to its native island.</p>

<p>Noyau is a <i>liqueur</i> made from brandy, flavored with bitter
almond.</p>

<p>Ratafia is a <i>liqueur</i> similar to Curaçoa and noyau, which is
flavored with peach and almond extracts and spiced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Anisette and kümmel have been already mentioned, the former
a cordial made by the French and Italians and flavored with aniseed;
the latter, a German and Russian <i>liqueur</i>, flavored with kümmel or
caraway seed.</p>

<p>Absinthe is a bitter and aromatic cordial, the bitterness being
due to the use of wormwood in its preparation. It is particularly
pernicious and treacherous to use if taken before meals, as is
often the custom, instead of afterward. It is largely used by the
French.</p>

<p>Maraschino is an aromatic cordial, the flavor of which is produced
by the use of the bitter almond and the Italian cherry.</p>

<p>Chartreuse was originally prepared by the monks of a monastery
of that name in France. For obvious reasons the Pope prohibited
its manufacture by them in 1864 and the original receipt
was lost. There are four kinds now made, of which the green is perhaps
the most popular. Chartreuse possesses the fragrance of
garden herbs, the aroma of various spices, flowers and nuts, and even
the balsamy fragrance of the young, green tassel from the pine tree.
These cordials are more largely used in France and Italy than anywhere
else. Owing to a growing sentiment against their use, they
are tolerated to only a limited extent in America although, because
of their common use as flavorings, they are here mentioned.</p>

<p>Vegetable acids are also largely used for the flavoring of foods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
One of the oldest known is verjuice, used by the ancients as a beverage.
Its use in cookery is believed to have originated in mediæval
France. It is made from the juice of crab-apples and of unripe
grapes.</p>

<p>Vinegar is a developed acid. The word comes from the French
<i>vin-aigre</i>, meaning sour wine. If simple cane sugar be mixed with
water and some ferment, it will turn to grape sugar, then to alcohol,
then to vinegar. However, the best vinegar now used is a fruit acid,
either from apple or grape. It is also made from the red and white
wines and from sour beer, the latter being known as malt vinegar.
In England the law allows a percentage of sulphuric acid to be
added to malt vinegar while in America both sulphuric and muriatic
acids are considered adulterants. Vinegar is the one indispensable
ingredient of pickles and various sauces as well as a valuable
condiment.</p>

<p>Limes and lemons, similar fruits, contain large quantities of
acid which is thoroughly wholesome and agreeable. To some extent
these acids are displacing vinegar as condiments, being considered
both more health giving and more palatable.</p>

<p>The most complete and instructive exhibition of condiments
and spices ever given was held in the Agricultural Building during
the World’s Columbian Exposition. The nations of all the earth
contributed. There were capers and olives from Italy, spices from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Java, chutney from Trinidad, Calcutta, and the far away island of
Ceylon; ketchup from both England and America, cassareep and
pickled limes from British Guiana, soy from China and Japan, and
pickles from lands galore. The long, daintily curved, vanilla bean
was exhibited side by side with its short, fat, plebeian looking
adulterant, the tonka bean. Cordials were sent from every
country exhibiting. There was in one portion of the building a
small conservatory filled with growing spice plants, among them
pimento, ginger, clove, nutmeg, pepper, cassia and cinnamon.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
